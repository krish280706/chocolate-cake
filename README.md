# HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE CAKE
The world famous Hershey’s Perfectly Chocolate Cake recipe ticks all your chocolate-loving boxes: EASY, QUICK AND AMAZING RESULTS.

TIPS: Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl first to get rid of any hard lumps caused during storage, while getting more air into the mixture.

Then add in your wet ingredients. Just keep in mind that the cake batter is VERY thin. Don’t be tempted to add more flour as this is what makes the cake super soft and moist.

The ONLY thing you can add to this already perfect cake recipe is a couple teaspoons of instant coffee or espresso for an even deeper chocolate flavour. Of course, this is totally and COMPLETELY optional. You cannot taste the coffee flavour.

# How do you make the best chocolate cake?
Make sure you preheat your oven before starting. We’ve included temperatures for standard AND fan or convention ovens.
If using springform pans, note that they are NOT 100% leakproof. Very thin cake batters such as this one will leak through the base. To combat this issue, line the base with parchment paper coming up where the sides meets the base to create a ‘cover’. Place a baking sheet on the shelf below the cake pan (or the bottom of the oven) to catch any stray drips. Don’t put cake pans directly on the pan as the heat will effect the base of your cakes.
Let cakes cool COMPLETELY before frosting. You can make this chocolate cake the day before and frost the next day.
